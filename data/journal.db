It is not a normal village, and is not inhabited by normal people. It is built of rotting wooden walkways connecting earth mounds that act as platforms for shacks, tents, and wobbly houses.</span></p><p style=\"box-sizing:border-box;user-select:text;margin:0.5em 0px\"><span style=\"font-family:Signika, sans-serif\">Its population is composed of witches, outlaws, misfits, heretics and magical creatures. Hunted down throughout the lands, this dark muddy patch of the kingdom is the last place left where these people can exist in relative safety.</span></p><p style=\"box-sizing:border-box;user-select:text;margin:0.5em 0px\"><span style=\"font-family:Signika, sans-serif\">Rumours and tales of the village are whispered far throughout the lands. Most say the village is a cesspit of criminals and evil demon worshippers and that the village should be stamped out before it grows in size. While some folk say that the witches there will heal the sick if brought to them.</span></p><p style=\"box-sizing:border-box;user-select:text;margin:0.5em 0px\"><span style=\"font-family:Signika, sans-serif\">The king had the village evicted and burned to the ground some years ago, but the village has since been rebuilt and re-occupied. Folk throughout the kingdom speak of the king's plans for a second eviction, one that will end the occupation once and for all.</span></p><header class=\"journal-page-header\" style=\"box-sizing:border-box;user-select:text;color:rgb(25, 24, 19);font-family:Signika, sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-variant-ligatures:normal;font-variant-caps:normal;font-weight:400;letter-spacing:normal;orphans:2;text-align:start;text-indent:0px;text-transform:none;white-space:normal;widows:2;word-spacing:0px;-webkit-text-stroke-width:0px;text-decoration-thickness:initial;text-decoration-style:initial;text-decoration-color:initial\"><h3 data-anchor=\"lighting\" style=\"box-sizing:border-box;user-select:text;margin:0px 0px 0.5rem;padding:0px;font-weight:normal;font-size:1.25em;border-bottom:1px solid var(--color-underline-header)\"><span style=\"font-family:Signika, sans-serif\">Lighting</span></h3></header><section class=\"journal-page-content\" style=\"box-sizing:border-box;user-select:text;color:rgb(25, 24, 19);font-family:Signika, sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-variant-ligatures:normal;font-variant-caps:normal;font-weight:400;letter-spacing:normal;orphans:2;text-align:start;text-indent:0px;text-transform:none;white-space:normal;widows:2;word-spacing:0px;-webkit-text-stroke-width:0px;text-decoration-thickness:initial;text-decoration-style:initial;text-decoration-color:initial\"><p style=\"box-sizing:border-box;user-select:text;margin:0.5em 0px\"><span style=\"font-family:Signika, sans-serif\">The swamp does not get much light, as it is situated in a valley and the forest surrounding it casts a strange dark shadow over the village. The people of the village keep the walkways lit with magical candles and lanterns and the moon seems to visit much more often than the sun does here.</span></p><header class=\"journal-page-header\" style=\"box-sizing:border-box;user-select:text;color:rgb(25, 24, 19);font-family:Signika, sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-variant-ligatures:normal;font-variant-caps:normal;font-weight:400;letter-spacing:normal;orphans:2;text-align:start;text-indent:0px;text-transform:none;white-space:normal;widows:2;word-spacing:0px;-webkit-text-stroke-width:0px;text-decoration-thickness:initial;text-decoration-style:initial;text-decoration-color:initial\"><h3 data-anchor=\"food\" style=\"box-sizing:border-box;user-select:text;margin:0px 0px 0.5rem;padding:0px;font-weight:normal;font-size:1.25em;border-bottom:1px solid var(--color-underline-header)\"><span style=\"font-family:Signika, sans-serif\">Food</span></h3><p><span style=\"font-family:Signika, sans-serif\">The people of Woodfall cultivate giant mushrooms as a staple food source since most crops will not grow in the dark, watery valley. Many of the inhabitants keep chickens and rabbits for eggs and meat. Hunting of swamp creatures is another food source as well as foraging of edible plants from the dark forest. They also trade with surrounding villages for crops.</span></p><h2><span style=\"font-family:Signika, sans-serif\"><strong>Woodfall's Economy</strong></span></h2><p><span style=\"font-family:Signika, sans-serif\">A lot of Woodfall's gold profits come through black market activity. But inside the town, the law dictates that people can be artisans and operate individual businesses as long as they own all their own tools and resources. People of Woodfall also operate cooperative businesses, where everyone shares the tools, profits, and decision-making process.</span></p><header class=\"journal-page-header\" style=\"box-sizing:border-box;user-select:text;color:rgb(25, 24, 19);font-family:Signika, sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-variant-ligatures:normal;font-variant-caps:normal;font-weight:400;letter-spacing:normal;orphans:2;text-align:start;text-indent:0px;text-transform:none;white-space:normal;widows:2;word-spacing:0px;-webkit-text-stroke-width:0px;text-decoration-thickness:initial;text-decoration-style:initial;text-decoration-color:initial\"><p><span style=\"font-family:Signika, sans-serif\">Everyone in the town is given their own 1/3 acre plot for cultivating mushrooms and other plants. Some residents combine plots and farm them together. Others own their plot privately and use it for rearing animals or other uses.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family:Signika, sans-serif\">Tax is voluntary in Woodfall; residents opt in to give taxes towards services they want to support. One of these services is a coin welfare system, which is funded in large part from the thieves guild.</span></p></header><h2><span style=\"font-family:Signika, sans-serif\">Property</span></h2><p><span style=\"font-family:Signika, sans-serif\">People in Woodfall own individual property such as their personal possessions, their plot, their business tools and building, and their houses. But the walkways, healing supplies, infrastructure, woodlands and rare or large tools are communally owned. It is law in Woodfall that individuals cannot expand their plots, and all are of equal size. It is also law that an individual cannot own property that they are not using (except if in jail or on holiday/travelling etc ). Anyone can build a house in the woods around Woodfall, but permission is needed to build or move into a house on a mound island, from the residents who live on the intended island.</span></p><img src=\"http://localhost:30000/worlds/dnd/assets/pages/tYng03rUrTGOihkX-pages-aHQx2pRyAuWBzywm-image-zFvj2LcrhTkDrdAd.png\" style=\"box-sizing:border-box;user-select:text;border:1px solid var(--color-border-dark);border-radius:2px;max-width:100%;cursor:pointer\" /><h2></h2><h2><span style=\"font-family:Signika, sans-serif\">Woodfall Legal System</span></h2><p><span style=\"font-family:Signika, sans-serif\">The following by-laws have been collectively written up and agreed upon by residents of Woodfall. A referendum on any law can be called at any time. Laws are passed if sixty percent of residents agree, unless more than three percent of the population casts special votes to block the proposal. In this case, a new version of the law is proposed until it is passed or  ropped. Spontaneous juries deal with cases.</span></p><ol><li><p><span style=\"font-family:Signika, sans-serif\">Stealing from people within Woodfall is illegal - offenders will be fined; repeated offenders, banished.</span></p></li><li><p><span style=\"font-family:Signika, sans-serif\">If you are being a loud, annoying drunk at night, it is legal for residents to cast silence charms on you.</span></p></li><li><p><span style=\"font-family:Signika, sans-serif\">It's illegal to expand your land plot.</span></p></li><li><p><span style=\"font-family:Signika, sans-serif\">It's illegal to own vacant property (unless travelling or in jail).</span></p></li><li><p><span style=\"font-family:Signika, sans-serif\">Witch burners will be burned at the stake.</span></p></li><li><p><span style=\"font-family:Signika, sans-serif\">Kingdom spies will be fed to swamp monsters.</span></p></li><li><p><span style=\"font-family:Signika, sans-serif\">It's illegal to be too wealthy - nobody can hold more than 8000 gold pieces in personal savings and/or speculative assets.</span></p></li><li><p><span style=\"font-family:Signika, sans-serif\">All taxes are voluntary.</span></p></li><li><p><span style=\"font-family:Signika, sans-serif\">Each mound is semi autonomous and has power over who can build there, live there, set up a business there, waste disposal and all decisions concerning that mound.</span></p></li><li><p><span style=\"font-family:Signika, sans-serif\">All residents of Woodfall can own and carry however many weapons and practice any kind of magic they want as long as it does not involve sacrifice of intelligent creatures or in some other way involuntarily harms an intelligent creature as a necessary part of its practice.</span></p><ul><li><p><span style=\"font-family:Signika, sans-serif\">Skin weavers (a school of magic) will be stripped of their powers</span></p></li><li><p><span style=\"font-family:Signika, sans-serif\">Necromancy is legal as long as there is written consent prior to death, or the necromancer is raising an animal</span></p></li><li><p><span style=\"font-family:Signika, sans-serif\">Summoning creatures from other planes is illegal - go far away from the village if you want to try that</span></p></li><li><p><span style=\"font-family:Signika, sans-serif\">Charming people is illegal, punishable by compensation or banishment depending on the severity of the manipulation.</span></p></li><li><p><span style=\"font-family:Signika, sans-serif\">Love potions are illegal.</span></p></li></ul></li></ol><h2><span style=\"font-family:Signika, sans-serif\">Organization Structure</span></h2><p><span style=\"font-family:Signika, sans-serif\">Each house in Woodfall is independent and makes its own decisions about things that</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family:Signika, sans-serif\">affect it through consensus or voting.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family:Signika, sans-serif\">Each island group sends revolving representatives to a general meeting every week. The purpose of the general meetings is to facilitate large decisions, but the representatives have no power and all decision making power lies with the island groups.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family:Signika, sans-serif\">Each group of houses on an island make decisions about anything affecting that island.</span></p><img src=\"worlds/dnd/assets/pages/tYng03rUrTGOihkX-pages-kTB8oZTGl6VRz7Wn-image-zgRoh4tD2wkGV3ZZ.png\" /><h2><span style=\"font-family:Signika, sans-serif\">Voluntary Associations</span></h2><h3><span style=\"font-family:Signika, sans-serif\">Woodfall Scouts Association (WSA)</span></h3><p><span style=\"font-family:Signika, sans-serif\">Is a group of residents that act as watchdogs for eviction threats, monster movements in the swamp and woodlands, and other dangers. They are equipped with non-lethal wands made by the spell sharing society.</span></p><h3><span style=\"font-family:Signika, sans-serif\">Woodfall Welfare group (WWG)</span></h3><p><span style=\"font-family:Signika, sans-serif\">This is a revolving group of residents who manage and redistribute donated cash, resources and food to the needy. Any player who decides to become a Woodfall resident is entitled to WWG welfare, which, combined with farming their plot, would barely cover their living expenses. Abusing the W.W.G is punishable by fines.</span></p><h3><span style=\"font-family:Signika, sans-serif\">Woodfall Artisans Guild (WAG)</span></h3><p><span style=\"font-family:Signika, sans-serif\">This is a revolving group of artisan residents who offer small grants to help folks buy tools and equipment needed to start new businesses.</span></p><h3><span style=\"font-family:Signika, sans-serif\">Healers Association (HA)</span></h3><p><span style=\"font-family:Signika, sans-serif\">Is a group of resident healers. They operate out of the healing tent. The HA has limited  resources and does not prioritize healing adventurers.</span></p><h3><span style=\"font-family:Signika, sans-serif\">Crisis Action Team (CAT)</span></h3><p><span style=\"font-family:Signika, sans-serif\">Is a group of female residents (mostly witches) who run a large house of hospitality that women escaping abuse or arranged marriages in the surrounding country can come and permanently live in. CAT sometimes plans covert transport operations for people fleeing particularly dangerous situations. They also offer witch training to the residents of the house of hospitality.</span></p><h3>The Faerie Liberation Front (FLF)</h3><p>The Faerie Liberation Front is a resistance movement among faeries which fights against the enslavement and exploitation of faeries. In Woodfall, the FLF's base of operations is in the second biggest tree. Existing characters can get involved in the FLF's operations, or players could make faerie characters and play a whole campaign around these themes and struggles.</p><h2><span style=\"font-family:Signika, sans-serif\">Necromancy In Woodfall</span></h2><p><span style=\"font-family:Signika, sans-serif\">Necromancy is legal in Woodfall as long as there was clear expressed permission from the person who is to be raised before they died. Because of this, Woodfall has been called \"skeleton village\" by some in the kingdom. There are a small number of intelligent undead residents of Woodfall because this is the only settlement they can come to where they can live amongst others and not be killed on sight. Many residents of Woodfall write letters of permission for necromancers to raise their skeletons after some time. They believe it is useful for the village because skeletons can perform menial labour and contribute much without consuming resources.</span></p><h2>Faeries of Woodfall</h2><p>Faeries are imprisoned as slaves and traded all over the kingdom. Among nobles, faeries are collected, as they are believed to render luck on the family's house, bringing power and fortune. Wizards also use faeries as live subjects for their magical experiments. Faerieeaters are a group of monsters who absorb magical powers when they consume faeries. They often make contact with human societies and threaten to inflict harm if they are not provided with a stock of faeries. Most of the magical trees that faeries used as villages and to remain hidden from big folk have been snuffed out by faerie catchers. One of the only safe places left for faeries to exist is Woodfall, where according to Woodfall law, they are treated as equals. Woodfall is also the only remaining faerie safe place where faeries live around big folk. The faeries who decide to live there often do so to join the operations of the Woodfall Faerie Liberation Front, which is based there and is the most successful branch.</p></header></section></section>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}},{"sort":100000,"name":"The Magic Mask Shop","type":"text","_id":"l7X3SeLzKKIr5sbU","title":{"show":true,"level":1},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<h2>Description</h2><h3>Outside</h3><p>A tiny wooden shack with a moon painted on the door, above which the words “Mask</p><p>Shop” are scrawled in black paint.</p><h3>Inside</h3><p>It's cramped inside and as cold as outside.

There is a cabinet with doors on both sides, where characters will be asked to place the example of the document they want forged. Once the doors are closed on the character's side of the curtain, the other doors will be opened on the forger's side and they will take the example, inspect it and tell the players if and when the job can be done.</p><section id=\"secret-efryBq5d9Dj6orsd\" class=\"secret\"><p>Forgeries are expensive.
